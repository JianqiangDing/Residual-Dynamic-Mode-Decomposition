    Find the closest indices of the given values of an array in another array
    using dynamic programming to ensure global optimal solution with unique indices.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    short_array : array-like
        The array with values that need to find corresponding indices
    long_array : array-like
        The array from which to find the closest indices
    dist : callable
        Function to calculate the distance between two given numbers, R Ã— R -> R

    Returns:
    --------
    numpy.ndarray
        Array of indices from long_array that correspond to closest matches
        for each element in short_array, maintaining one-to-one correspondence

    Raises:
    -------
    ValueError
        If short_array is longer than long_array or if arrays are empty
    TypeError

    Examples:
    ---------
