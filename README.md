# Residual-Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition

Computation of spectral properties of Koopman operators associated with discrete-time autonomous dynamical systems. Highlights include: verified computation of spectra with error control and computation of spectral measures with explicit high-order convergence.

Code for the papers:

1. M.J. Colbrook, A. Townsend, "Rigorous data-driven computation of spectral properties of Koopman operators for dynamical systems"

2. M.J. Colbrook, L. Ayton, M. Sz≈ëke, "Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Robust and verified Koopmanism"

The code is split into "main_routines" which are used across the papers. Each paper has a gallery of examples. Within each folder of examples, subfolders need to be added to the path for datasets etc. Some of the code also makes use of Chebfun, which can be found at https://www.chebfun.org/.
