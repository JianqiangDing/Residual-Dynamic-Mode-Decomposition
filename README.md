# Residual-Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition

Computation of spectral properties of Koopman operators associated with discrete-time autonomous dynamical systems. Highlights include: verified computation of spectra with error control (and avoidance of spurious modes) and computation of spectral measures with explicit high-order convergence.

This repository will grow as further papers are written and if you are interested in collaborating, please get in touch at: m.colbrook@damtp.cam.ac.uk

The code includes **"main_routines"** that are used across the papers (see that subfolder for the additional README file). Each paper has a gallery of examples.

To get started on a simple example, try the file **"Duffing_example.m"**
