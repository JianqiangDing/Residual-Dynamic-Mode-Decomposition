# Residual-Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition

Computation of spectral properties of Koopman operators associated with discrete-time autonomous dynamical systems. Highlights include: verified computation of spectra with error control (and avoidance of spurious modes) and computation of spectral measures with explicit high-order convergence.

This repository will grow as further papers are written and if you are interested in collaborating, please get in touch at: m.colbrook@damtp.cam.ac.uk

The code includes **"main_routines"** that are used across the papers (see that subfolder for the additional README file). Each paper has a gallery of examples.

To get started on a simple example, try the file Duffing_example.m

**Datasets** (needed for some of the examples) can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xj59e5in7dfsobi/AAAfkxqa1x9WFSTgrvqoqqRqa?dl=0

Some of the code for setting up the examples makes use of Chebfun, which can be found at https://www.chebfun.org/.
