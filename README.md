# Residual-Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition

Computation of spectral properties of Koopman operators associated with discrete-time autonomous dynamical systems. Highlights include: verified computation of spectra with error control and computation of spectral measures with explicit high-order convergence.

Code for the papers:

1. M.J. Colbrook, A. Townsend, "Rigorous data-driven computation of spectral properties of Koopman operators for dynamical systems"

2. M.J. Colbrook, L. Ayton, M. Sz≈ëke, "Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Robust and verified Koopmanism"

Currently the code consists of only the main routines. I am in the process of building a gallery of examples that use the code.
